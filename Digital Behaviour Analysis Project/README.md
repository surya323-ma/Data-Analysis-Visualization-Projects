# Digital Behaviour Analysis Project! 📊📱

In today’s digital world, our smartphones quietly track how we spend our time - from screen usage to app activity and phone unlocks.

Chef has collected daily digital behaviour data to better understand his phone habits.
But raw numbers alone don’t reveal much insight.

Chef wants answers like:

How does his daily screen time change over time?
Is he crossing his daily usage limit?
Chef needs your help to transform this data into meaningful visual insights using Matplotlib library.

Important Notes
You are given a single file: main.py:
Do NOT change function names: The testing system relies on them.
Do NOT use plt.show(): This project runs in a "headless" environment (no screen). You must use plt.savefig("filename.png") to generate output.
Do NOT close the plot after saving: Do not call plt.close() or similar functions after saving the plot.
All functions are already defined in main.py. You need to complete the missing logic.
# Test results
Test 1: Have you loaded the dataset correctly and sorted it by date?
Test 2: Have you created the figure layout and daily usage trend plot with correct size and structure?
Test 3: Have you added correct titles, labels, legends, and rotated date labels in the daily trends plot?
Test 4: Have you visualized unlocks vs screen time using a scatter plot with correct mapping and transparency?
Test 5: Have you adjusted the layout properly and saved the plot successfully?
