Instagram Viral Trends Analytics Project! 📸✨

Every day, millions of posts are uploaded on Instagram - but only a few go viral. Some posts get massive reach, while others barely reach their audience - even when they look similar.

Chef manages multiple Instagram pages and has collected post-level engagement data to understand:

Which engagement metrics move together?
Do hashtags really increase reach?
Why do some posts perform far better (or worse) than expected?
Raw numbers alone can’t answer these questions. Chef needs your help to analyze Instagram engagement patterns.

Important Notes
You are given a single file: main.py:

Do NOT change function names: The testing system relies on them.
Do NOT use plt.show(): This project runs in a "headless" environment (no screen). You must use plt.savefig("filename.png") to generate output.
Do NOT close the plot after saving: Do not call plt.close() or similar functions after saving the plot.
All functions are already defined in main.py. You need to complete the missing logic.
