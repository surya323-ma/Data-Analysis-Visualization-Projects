# FlightFlow Analysis Project
Air travel plays a major role in today’s fast-moving world, but delays can turn even a short journey into a frustrating experience.
Chef is planning multiple domestic and international trips. To avoid unnecessary delays, he has collected real-world flight data containing information such as:

Flight dates
Airlines
Departure delays
Chef needs your help to analyze this dataset. Your task is to use the Pandas library to clean, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from flight delay data.

What’s Already Provided
You are given a single file: main.py

All required function names are already defined.
The program flow is already set up.
You only need to complete the missing logic using the Pandas Library.
Do NOT change function names or print statements.
Dataset
In this Project, you will work with a CSV file named: flights.csv
